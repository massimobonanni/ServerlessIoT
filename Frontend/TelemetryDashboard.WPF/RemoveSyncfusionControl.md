# Syncfusion license

This project uses the Syncfusion WPF Controls ([https://www.syncfusion.com/wpf-ui-controls](https://www.syncfusion.com/wpf-ui-controls)) and, in particular, the SfChart control ([https://www.syncfusion.com/kb/wpf/sfchart](https://www.syncfusion.com/kb/wpf/sfchart)).

If you have a valid license, you can ue it following the next steps:
1. Create a text file called `license.local.txt` in the root folder of the TelemetryDashboard.WPF project;
2. Insert your license code in that file.

If you haven't a vlid license, you can follow the next steps to remove the charts from the project:
1. In the `MainWindow.xaml` file, find the region `<!-- Comment this region if you don't have Syncfusion License -->`;
2. Remove (or comment as you prefer) the region.
